Lately I've been reading a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/r">Accelerate - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations</a>.

Some memorable quotes from the book are:<br /><br />

> The most innovative companies and highest-performing organizations are always striving to be better and never consider themselves “mature” or “done” with their improvement or transformation journey—and we see this in our research.

<br />

> barriers that hide the work of deployment from developers are rarely good, because they isolate developers from the downstream consequences of their work

<br />

> Technology managers, like so many other well-meaning managers, often try to fix the person while ignoring the work environment

<br />

> Women are leaving tech at a 45% higher rate than men

<br />

> A good leader affects a team’s ability to deliver code, architect good systems, and apply Lean principles to how the team manages its work and develops products

<br />

> The four measures of software delivery performance (deploy frequency, lead time, mean time to restore, change fail percentage)
